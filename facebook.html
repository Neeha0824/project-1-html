      <h3><div class="Ya"> <p><b>  As the king of social media, Facebook boasts a whopping 2.9 billion monthly active users. With such a massive user base, it is one of the best social media platforms for businesses to use for marketing.

        But before you do that, you need to first understand Facebook users' activities on the platform. In other words, you must answer the questions: What is Facebook used for and why do people use Facebook?

    <h2 style="color: rgb(181, 24, 24);">Top Uses of Facebook :</h2>
        
    
    <p><h3><b class="f">
        According to the latest data on the top uses of Facebook, the two most popular activities on the platform are messaging friends and family and posting or sharing photos or videos. As many as 71 percent of users on Facebook say they use the platform to chat with their loved ones, and 64.1 percent of them share media, whether that's on their own profiles or elsewhere. 
        This is followed by keeping informed. 59.2 percent of active Facebook users are on the platform to stay up to date with the latest news and events.</b><br>
        Following or researching brands and products is also why people use Facebook, with more than half (54.9 percent) of active Facebook users doing so.
        It should come as no surprise, then, that Facebook is the most popular social media marketing platform for brands. As many as 23.6 percent of marketers use Facebook to market their business. In comparison, 18.9 percent use Instagram and 17.6 percent use WhatsApp—both are owned by the same parent company as Facebook, Meta.
